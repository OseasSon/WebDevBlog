        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>

        <p>Web development is the field where web developers, or simply ‘web devs’, are responsible for the building and
            maintenance of websites. Their job is often related to make a website look nice, user friendly and perform
            great.
        </p>
        <p>In order to create an website with these aspects, they make use of a range of programming languages depending
            on the type of task and in which platform they want to perform it.
        </p>
        <p>This field covers many contents and for this reason, when we talk about web development, we usually divide it
            in two sides: the front end (client-side) and the back end (the server-side).
        </p>
        <p>The focus of this page is to approach only the client-side, as it was created for academic reasons. Said
            that, let's dive into the front end development world.
        </p><br>

        <h2>Front End Development</h2>

        <p>As said before, front end refers to the client-side development. The main approach here is to manage
            everything that is firstly seen by the user in their browsers, making the interface well instructed, looking
            nice and providing a positive user experience.
        </p>
        <p>In order to accomplished these tasks, front end developers make use of three main languages, which are also
            described in this site. To check out more about them, click on the links below:
