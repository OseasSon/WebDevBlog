        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <p><b>CSS</b> stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheets</b> and it is the language used to give style to a web page.
            While HTML
            deal with the page’s structure, CSS deals with how the page looks.</p>
        <p>A good analogy to make is to think about a web page as a building. All the walls, floors and the steel
            skeleton are represented by HTML. While all the painting, design and finishing are represented by CSS.
        </p>
        <p>As HTML, CSS is not a programming languages for the same reasons. It does not perform any programmed
            task and its purpose is only to design the layout for a page.</p>

        <h2>How does CSS work?</h2>

        <p>Let’s start with an example. The following HTML code represents a heading followed by a paragraph:
        </p>
        <p><code>&lth1&gtThis is my heading&lt/h1&gt</code><br><code>&ltp&gtSome text written here.&lt/p&gt</code></p>
        <p>In order to change the heading colour to red and the paragraph font family to arial, we would write the
            following CSS code:
        </p>
        <p><code>h1 {colour: red;}</code><br><code>p {font-family: Arial;}</code></p>
        <p>Note that the coding structure of CSS is formed by a selector (ex: h1) followed by semi columns, embedding a
            property (ex: colour), with some value (ex: red) attached to it. </p>
        <p>The selector refers to which HTML element the CSS code is interacting and the property is some characteristic of
            this element which has a value attached to it.</p>
        <p style="color:green;">Another good example is the colour of this paragraph that was given the value “green”
            using CSS code.
        </p>
        <p>These were only some examples of CSS, but in fact, the properties of elements and the values that you can
            give to it are numerous and it allows you to change anything that you want in your page.</p>
        <p>Another important thing to mention is that there are three ways to apply CSS code to your HTML page:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal</li>
            <li>Inline</li>
            <li>External</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Internal style sheets are written in the header of a .html document inside a <code>&ltstyle&gt</code> tag. It
            is useful if you want to apply the style to a whole single page.</p>
        <p>Inline style sheets are written inside a tag. It is useful if you want to give style for a single element
            inside your page. As it already indicates which element you want to modify, the code is written a bit
            different and it would look like this if you wanted to change a single heading colour:</p>
        <p><code>&lth1 style=”color:red;”&gtThis is my heading&lt/h1&gt</code></p>
        <p>Finally, external style sheets are written in a separated <code>.css</code> file and linked to a page by a
            <code>&ltlink&gt</code> tag placed in the head of the .html document. It is useful when you have more than
            one page (most of
            the cases) and you want to apply this style to all of these pages at once.
        </p>
        <p>In summary, <b>CSS</b> is the tool that you apply in a <a href="page2.html">HTML</a> file in order to make a
            web page attractive. However,
            there are still more that can be made to a web page, you can make it interactive with some scrip language
            such as <a href="page3.html">JavaScript</a>.</p><br>
