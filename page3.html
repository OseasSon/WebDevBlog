        <h2>JavaScript</h2>

        <p><b>JavaScrip</b>t is a script language or a programming language used to make a web page interactive and
            dynamic. In a building analogy, JavaScript would be everything that gives functionality to a building,
            such as light, elevators and running water. While HTML would be the structure and CSS would be the style of
            the building.
        </p>
        <p>Beside <a href="page1.html">HTML</a> and <a href="page2.html">CSS</a>, JavaScript creates the whole foundation for a web page. It is a must learn for every web
            developer. Before its creation, web pages were statics without any type of interaction. Implementing a
            script language to a web page brings the user experience to a higher level.
        </p>

        <h2>How does JavaScript work?</h2>

        <p>It works by performing programmed tasks on the client’s machine without the need to interact with a server,
            for this reason, it is known as a client-side script.
        </p>
        <p>For example, if you have a loaded web page on your browser and suddenly you lost the internet connection, you
            can still have access to the interacting elements on the page, such as animations or dropdown menus.
        </p>
        <p>Another good example of the power of a script language is the search engine on many web page. When you enter
            some text in Google’s search box, it automatically completes the text for you before you finish typing and
            at the same time gives you some alternative search suggestions. It is only possible thanks to script
            languages such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>On this page, you can see that every time you reload it, an alert pops up to you saying “Welcome to this
            page, enjoy your reading!”. It was made with the following JavaScript code:</p>
        <p><code>alert('Welcome to this page, enjoy your reading!');</code></p>
        <p>The <code>alert()</code> method displays an alert message every time the page is loaded.
        </p>
        <p>In the next example, JavaScript changes the image displayed depending on which button the user choose to
            click. When the user click on “Turn on the light” it displays an image of a yellow bulb, if they click on
            “Turn off the light” it displays an image of a transparent bulb.
        </p>

        <div class="container">
            <!--
            The light bulb. The lines 95 to 99 has been sourced from
            https://www.w3schools.com/
            Some changes where made by me. 
            -->
            <button onclick="turnOn()">Turn on the light</button>

            <img id="myImage" src='img/pic_bulboff.gif' style="width: 100px;">

            <button onclick="turnOff()">Turn off the light</button>
        </div>

        <p>It does it by changing the value of the
            source attribute of the image with the follwing functions.</p>
        <p><code>function turnOn() {<br>
            document.getElementById("myImage").src='img/pic_bulbon.gif';<br> 
        }<br>
        function turnOff() {<br>
            document.getElementById("myImage").src='img/pic_bulboff.gif';<br>
        }
        </code></p>

        <p>In order to perform those functions you need to add them inside the element you want the user to interact. In
            this case, I added the following code inside the <code>&ltbutton&gt</code> tag:</p>
        <p><code>&ltbutton onclick="turnOn()"&gtTurn on the light&lt/button&gt</code></p>
        <p><code>&ltbutton onclick="turnOff()"&gtTurn off the light&lt/button&gt</code></p>
        <p>These were only a few examples of the power of <b>JavaScript</b>. There are numerous other things that this script
            language allow us to do and that is why it is one of the most popular languages in the World.</p><br>
